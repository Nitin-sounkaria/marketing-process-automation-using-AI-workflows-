# B2B Marketing process automation using AI-workflows

This project is a comprehensive B2B marketing automation system designed to streamline business operations and boost growth using AI workflows. It showcases an end-to-end solution for modern marketing challenges, focusing on efficiency and scalability.

üöÄ Key Features
B2B International Lead Generation: Automated the entire lead-generation lifecycle. We used Store Leads to identify and qualify over 50,000 international business leads from 8 countries, then leveraged Rocket Reach to acquire contact information for over 5,000 of the most promising prospects.

AI-Powered Content Creation: Developed pipelines for high-quality e-commerce image and video generation. The system transforms raw, phone-captured images into professional-grade assets using custom generative AI models, drastically reducing content production time and cost.

SEO Automation: Built a bulk blog SEO workflow using a custom n8n automation. The system dynamically creates and optimizes blog content, integrating with platforms like Slack for notifications and Airtable for data management.

Influencer Marketing System: Created an AI-driven system to streamline and automate the management of influencer advertisement campaigns, from initial outreach to performance tracking.
